# File Types for Text Files

#### TXT (.txt):
##### This is the most common file type for plain text files. Plain text files do not recognize specialized text like bold or underlined or things like graphs and images. Plain text files are extremely compatiable with almost everything that uses text files. They are also mush smaller in size so they are easier to send and recieve compared to non-plain  text files.

#### DOC (.doc / .docx)
##### DOC is a file type most commonly used in Microsoft Word, although some other programs can open them too. DOC files are the opposite of TXT files because they can have specialized characters and other creative features like images and graphs embedded on the text document. DOC files lose out on the compatablility and small file size of a TXT file thought. The difference between .doc and .docx is that .docx is the predecessor of .doc and should be used over.doc in post-2007 versions of Word. DOC files can also be opened by Google Docs.

#### RTF (.rtf)
##### RTF is more of a middle ground between DOC and TXT file formats. The RTF file format allows for more creativity than the TXT format but less then the DOC format, but more compatibility than the DOC format but less than the TXT format.
