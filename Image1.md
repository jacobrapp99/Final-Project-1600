# Choice 1:
### Do you want to use a lossy or lossless image file type?

#### If you plan to use a lossy file type (for smaller files at the sacrifice of image quality), go here:
##### [Lossy Image File Types](https://github.com/jacobrapp99/Final-Project-1600/blob/main/ImageLossy.md)

#### If you plan to use a lossless file type (for better image quality but much bigger files), go here:
##### [Lossless Image File Types](https://github.com/jacobrapp99/Final-Project-1600/blob/main/ImageLossless.md)
