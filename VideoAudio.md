# Video File Types with Audio

### Here are video file types that allow audio that you can choose from for your video files
###### (Side Note: These are all lossy file formats as most consumer level video file types don't use lossless file types because the files would be to big)

#### MP4 (.mp4):
##### MP4 is the most famous file for videos arguably. It also has the ability to store still images and subtitles. MP4 is used on most popular sites (YouTube) as it features relatively small file sizes. 

#### AVI (.avi):
##### AVI is used specifically for the Windows OS. It is usually used for video files under 2GB. It uses less compression then most other video file types which results in higher quality videos. 

#### MOV (.mov):
##### MOV is primarily utilized by Mac OS systems and software like Apple's QuickTime Movie Player. These file types feature high bitrate videos with little to no compression resulting in high quality videos, but large files.

#### WebM (.webm):
##### WebM is a popular alternative for using in an HTML5 video tag.
