# Image File Types that Use Lossy Compression: 

### Here are image file types that utilize a lossy compression method to decrease file sizes and sacrifice quality

#### JPG (.jpg / .jpeg):
##### JPG is by far the most popular image file type. Becuase it is compressed in a lossy format, JPG does lose quality to drastically reduce file size while the sacrifice in quality is barely noticeable to the human eye if at all in most cases, this is why JPG is so popular. 

#### GIF (.gif):
##### While GIF is technically an image file type, it is mainly used to display pictures in motion that act as a video. GIF also sacrifices quality to create small file sizes which is why its a very popular way of spreading memes online that seem like videos.
