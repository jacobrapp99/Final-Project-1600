# Audio File Types that Use Lossy Compression: 

### Here are audio file types that utilize a lossy compression method to decrease file sizes and sacrifice quality

#### MP3 (.mp3):
##### MP3 is the most popular audio file type. It is used commonly to store almost all things audio, including music, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. MP3 compresses files to a much smaller file which is why most people use this file type to store copius amounts of music on a hard-drive.

#### AAC (.aac):
##### AAC is Apple's iTunes format and was supposed to be the successor to MP3. It has better encoding the MP3 which gives better sound quality while still obtaining smaller file sizes. It can be used and found on all sorts of different platforms including Nintendo, Windows OS, PlayStation, and now is used on Apple Music as the main file type.
