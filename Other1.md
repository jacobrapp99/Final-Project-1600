# Other File Types

### Most big software programs use there own file types for saving there projects also. Photoshop saves projects as PSD and Premiere Pro saves projects as PRPROJ. It is important that you use the file extension that the program wants you to use so that their software can correctly handle that file. 

### It is also important to note that the file types listed in this tutorial is not a comprehensive list. There are tons and tons of file types it would be impossible to list them all out. Even for file types like images or video, there are way more file formats then what i listed. I listed the most common ones and the ones that i would recommend using, but there are plenty more out there. I will leave a link to a website that will tell you everything you need to know about a file type below this.
