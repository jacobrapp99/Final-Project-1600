# Audio File Types that Use Lossless Compression: 

### Here are audio file types that utilize a lossless compression method to keep the highest quality at the sacrifice of increased file size

#### WAV (.wav):
##### WAV is the main format for Windows OS when it comes to uncompressed audio file types. It is the predecessor to MP33 and can still be found today, usually for storing things like sound effects. It is primarily used for storing waveform data.

#### AIFF (.aiff):
##### AIFF is pretty much the same as WAV, but for Mac OS.

#### FLAC (.flac):
##### FLAC is kind of like a MP3 file, however, it is compressed by about 60% without any loss in audio quality. This file format is probably the best for storing actual music in a lossless format because it helps decrease file size greatly.
