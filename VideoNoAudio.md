# Video File Types with No Audio

### Here is a video file type that stores no audio. There is only one listed and is the only one I recommend and have used

#### GIF (.gif):
##### GIF is technically an image file format, but because it is usually used to display moving pictures that look like videos, I am including it with videos. GIF uses a lot of compression to get very small file sizes while not sacrificing a ton of quality. Very popular on social media for memes and such.
