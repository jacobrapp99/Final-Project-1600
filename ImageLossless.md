# Image File Types that Use Lossless Compression: 

### Here are image file types that utilize a lossless compression method to keep the highest quality at the sacrifice of increased file size

#### PNG (.png):
##### PNG is the most popular lossless image file type by far. While JPG is better for storing full blown photographs and images because of the file size reduction, PNG is best for storing less intensive images like text or lines. PNG also boasts a feature where it supports transparency which means that the abckground of the image can be clear and transparent instead of having a colored background that you need to cut out in photoshop.

#### BMP (.bmp):
##### BMP is mainly used to store bitmap digital images and 2D digital photos. BMP uses the raster image format developed by Microsoft. BMP also supports monorchrome and color images at variable color bit depths.

#### RAW (.raw):
##### RAW file formats is footage with minimally rocessed data taken right from a digital camera and arenâ€™t processed yet. RAW files are very common among video editors and are very popular for color grading footage through software like DaVinci Resolve. RAW files can be more accurately edited.
